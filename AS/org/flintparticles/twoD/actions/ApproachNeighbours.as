	 * The ApproachNeighbours action applies an acceleration to the particle to 
	 * draw it towards other nearby particles. The size of the acceleration 
	 * is constant, only the direction varies. This differentiates this action
	 * from the MutualGravity action, where the acceleration is proportional
	 * to the distance between the particles.
	 * 
	 * <p>ApproachNeighbours is most commonly used when creating flocking
	 * behaviours. Flocking is usually a combination of ApproachNeighbours
	 * to draw particles together, MinimumDistance to stop them getting too close
	 * and MatchVelocity to make them match speed and direction of motion.</p>
