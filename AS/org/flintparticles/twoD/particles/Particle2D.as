	 * and Actions modify these properties directly. This means that the same
	 * particles can be used in many different emitters, allowing Particle 
	 * objects to be reused.
	 * 
	 * Particles are usually created by the ParticleCreator class. This class
	 * just simplifies the reuse of Particle objects which speeds up the
	 * application.
