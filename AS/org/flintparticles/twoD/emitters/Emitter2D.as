	/**
	 * The Emitter class manages the creation and ongoing state of particles. It uses a number of
	 * utility classes to customise its behaviour.
	 * 
	 * <p>An emitter uses Initializers to customise the initial state of particles
	 * that it creates, their position, velocity, color etc. These are added to the 
	 * emitter using the addInitializer  method.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>An emitter uses Actions to customise the behaviour of particles that
	 * it creates, to apply gravity, drag, fade etc. These are added to the emitter 
	 * using the addAction method.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>An emitter uses Activities to customise its own behaviour in an ongoing manner, to 
	 * make it move or rotate.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>An emitter uses a Counter to know when and how many particles to emit.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>An emitter uses a Renderer to display the particles on screen.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>All timings in the emitter are based on actual time passed, not on frames.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Most functionality is best added to an emitter using Actions,
	 * Initializers, Activities, Counters and Renderers. This offers greater 
	 * flexibility to combine behaviours witout needing to subclass 
	 * the Emitter itself.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>The emitter also has position properties - x, y, rotation - that can be used to directly
	 * affect its location in the particle system.
