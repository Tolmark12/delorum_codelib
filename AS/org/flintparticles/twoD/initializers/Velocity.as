	 * The ColorInit Initializer sets the velocity of the particle. It is

	 * using this velocity.
	 * 
	 * <p>The initial velocity is defined using a zone from the 
	 * org.flintparticles.twoD.zones package. The use of zones enables diverse 
	 * ranges of velocities. For example, to use a specific velocity,
	 * a Point zone can be used. To use a varied speed in a specific
	 * direction, a LineZone zone can be used. For a fixed speed in
	 * a varied direction, a Disc or DiscSector zone with identical
	 * inner and outer radius can be used. A Disc or DiscSector with
	 * different inner and outer radius produces a range of speeds
	 * in a range of directions.
