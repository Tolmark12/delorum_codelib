	 * The InitializerBase class is the abstract base class for all particle 
	 * initializers in the Flint library. It implements the Initializer interface 
	 * with a default priority of zero and empty methods for the rest of the 
	 * interface.
	 * 
	 * <p>Instances of the InitializerBase class should not be directly created 
	 * because the InitializerBase class itself simply implements the Initializer
	 * interface with default methods that do nothing.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Developers creating custom initializers may either extend the 
	 * InitializerBase class or implement the Initializer interface directly. 
	 * Classes that extend the InitializerBase class need only to implement their 
	 * own functionality for the methods they want to use, leaving other methods 
	 * with their default empty implementations.
