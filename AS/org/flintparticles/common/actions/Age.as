	 * The Age action operates in conjunction with the Lifetime

	 * the particle. The Age action then ages the particle over time,
	 * altering its energy to reflect its age. This energy can then
	 * be used by actions like Fade and ColorChange to alter the
	 * appearence of the particle as it ages.
	 *

	 * a function that modifies the aging process, to ease in or out or 
	 * to alter the aging in other ways.</p>

	 * easing functions in the org.flintparticles.common.energy package
	 * along with any custom easing functions that have the same interface.</p>
