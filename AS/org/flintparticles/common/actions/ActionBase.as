	 * The ActionBase class is the abstract base class for all particle actions

	 * priority of zero and empty methods for the rest of the interface.
	 * 
	 * <p>Instances of the ActionBase class should not be directly created because 
	 * the ActionBase class itself simply implements the Action interface with 
	 * default methods that do nothing.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Developers creating custom actions may either extend the ActionBase
	 * class or implement the Action interface directly. Classes that extend the 
	 * ActionBase class need only to implement their own functionality for the 
	 * methods they want to use, leaving other methods with their default empty
	 * implementations.
