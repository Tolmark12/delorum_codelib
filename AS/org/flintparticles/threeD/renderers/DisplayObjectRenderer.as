	/**
	 * The DisplayObjectRenderer is a native Flint 3D renderer that draws particles
	 * as display objects in the renderer. The particles are drawn face-on to the
	 * camera, with perspective applied to position and scale the particles.
	 * 
	 * <p>Particles may be represented by any DisplayObject and each particle 
	 * must use a different DisplayObject instance. The DisplayObject
	 * to be used should not be defined using the SharedImage initializer
	 * because this shares one DisplayObject instance between all the particles.
	 * The ImageClass initializer is commonly used because this creates a new 
	 * DisplayObject for each particle.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>The DisplayObjectRenderer has mouse events disabled for itself and any 
	 * display objects in its display list. To enable mouse events for the renderer
	 * or its children set the mouseEnabled or mouseChildren properties to true.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Because the DisplayObject3DRenderer directly uses the particle's image,
	 * it is not suitable in situations where the same particle will be displayed 
	 * by two different renderers.</p>
