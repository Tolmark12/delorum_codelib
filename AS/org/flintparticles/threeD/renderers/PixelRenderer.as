	 * The PixelRenderer is a native Flint 3D renderer that draws particles
	 * as single pixels on a Bitmap display object.
	 * 
	 * <p>The region of the projection plane drawn by this renderer must be 
	 * defined in the canvas property of the BitmapRenderer. Particles outside this 
	 * region are not drawn.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>The PixelRenderer allows the use of BitmapFilters to modify the appearance
	 * of the bitmap. Every frame, under normal circumstances, the Bitmap used to
	 * display the particles is wiped clean before all the particles are redrawn.
	 * However, if one or more filters are added to the renderer, the filters are
	 * applied to the bitmap instead of wiping it clean. This enables various trail
	 * effects by using blur and other filters.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>The PixelRenderer has mouse events disabled for itself and any 
	 * display objects in its display list. To enable mouse events for the renderer
	 * or its children set the mouseEnabled or mouseChildren properties to true.</p>

		 * addEmitter method. The renderer displays all the particles created
		 * by the emitter's that have been added to it.</p>
